  <p>
    The She Beat Me To It Ballers opened their season in dominant fashion on Monday night,
    rolling past Benchwarmers Elite by a final score of 58–15 in front of a home crowd.
    From the opening tip, the Ballers set the tone with aggressive defense and fast-paced offense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aiden and Jack jump-started the scoring early, attacking the basket and creating easy
    opportunities in transition. The Ballers forced multiple turnovers in the first half,
    quickly turning defense into offense and building a commanding lead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tom delivered one of the most complete performances of the night, finishing with 12 points
    while anchoring the defense. His energy and leadership helped keep the Ballers locked in
    throughout the game, earning him Player of the Game honors.
  </p>

  <p>
    By halftime, the outcome was already decided, but the Ballers continued to play with intensity.
    The team shared the ball well, moved without it, and gave meaningful minutes to everyone on
    the roster as the lead continued to grow.
  </p>

  <p>
    The convincing victory marked an ideal start to the season and gave the Ballers momentum
    heading into their second game of the night.
